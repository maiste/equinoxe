(* Ideally this should be an [Fdecl], but there are currently two reasons why
   it's not:

   - We read the workspace file before we start the inotify watcher, so [init]
   is called after [t_ref] is used. This means we have to invalidate some
   entries of t when [init] is called and set up subscriptions.

   - There are tests that call [Scheduler.go] multiple times, therefore [init]
   gets called multiple times. Since they don't use file watcher, it shouldn't
   be a problem. *)

(* CR-someday aalekseyev: For [watch_path] to work correctly we need to ensure
   that the parent directory of [path] exists. That is certainly not guaranteed
   by the [Fs_memo] API, so we should do something to make it more robust, but I
   believe that is masked by the fact that we usually (always?) look at the
   source directory before looking for files in that directory.

   It might seem that the [ENOENT] "fall back" trick used below can be extended
   to fall back all the way to the root, but it can't because subscribing to the
   root is not sufficient to receive events for creation of "root/a/b/c/d".

   file system access functions in one place, and exposing an uncached version

(* CR-someday amokhov: The way we currently treat file system events is simple
   and robust but doesn't take advantage of all the information we receive. Here
   are some ideas for future optimisation:

   - Don't invalidate [path_exists] queries on [File_changed] events.

   - If a [path_exists] query currently returns [true] and we receive a
   corresponding [File_deleted] event, we can change the query's result to
   [false] without rerunning the [Path.exists] function (and vice versa).

   - Similarly, the result of [dir_contents] queries can be updated without
   calling [Path.readdir_unsorted_with_kinds]: we know which file or directory
   should be added to or removed from the result. *)
