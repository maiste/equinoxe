  (* Here are some idealized assumptions the Fs_memo module in dune_engine makes
     about events:

     - If a file is renamed, we receive [Created] and [Deleted] events with
     corresponding paths.

     - If a directory is renamed then in addition to the [Created] and [Deleted]
     events for the directory itself, we receive events about all file and
     directory paths in the corresponding file tree.

     - Similarly, if a directory is deleted, we receive the [Deleted] event for
     the directory itself, as well as deletion events for all watched paths in
     the corresponding file tree.

     Not all of these assumptions we can currently uphold. In particular,
     directory renames probably just give "created" and "deleted" for the
     directory itself, which means we are not correctly handling directory
     renames. *)
