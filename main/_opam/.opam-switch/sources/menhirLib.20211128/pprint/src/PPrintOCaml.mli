(** A set of functions that construct representations of OCaml values. *)

(** The string representations produced by these functions are supposed to be
    accepted by the OCaml parser as valid values. *)

(** The signature of this module is compatible with that expected by
    the [camlp4] generator [Camlp4RepresentationGenerator]. *)

(** These functions do {i not} distinguish between mutable and immutable
    values. They do {i not} recognize sharing, and do {i not} incorporate a
    protection against cyclic values. *)

    constructor is [dc] and whose arguments are [args]. The other two
    parameters are presently unused. *)

(** [record _ fields] is a description of a record value whose fields are
    [fields]. The other parameter is presently unused. *)
