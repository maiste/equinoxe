# Generated code from fiat

This directory includes several files ("p*.h") that are generated by
[fiat](https://github.com/mit-plv/fiat-crypto). The Makefile provides
targets to generate these files.

The file "inversion_template.h" is copied from the fiat-crypto repository
at e31a36d5f1b20134e67ccc5339d88f0ff3cb0f86 (inversion-c/inversion_template.c),
and has some modifications: the "inversion" function is declared "static",
and the convenience function "inversion" is provided.

The "*_stubs.c" files are handcrafted.
