  (** The type for structured keys. *)

  val empty: t
  (** [empty] is the empty key. It refers to the top-level
     dictionary. *)

  val v : string -> t
  (** [v s] is the string [s] as a key. A key ["/foo/bar"] is
     decomposed into the segments ["foo"] and ["bar"]. The initial

     equal. *)

  val parent : t -> t
  (** [parent t] is the key without the last segment. [parent empty]
     is [empty].

      For any [t], the invariant have [parent t / basename t] is [t].

  (** The equality function for keys. *)

      {!exists} answers two questions: does the key exist and is it
      referring to a value or a dictionary.

  val get: t -> key -> (string, error) result Lwt.t

     time is the latest modification of all entries in that
     dictionary. This behaviour is only one level deep and not recursive. *)

      Since a batch is applied at once, the readings inside a batch
     will return the state before the entire batch. Concurrent
     operations will not affect other ones executed during the batch.

      Batch applications can fail to apply if other operations are
     happening concurrently. In case of failure, [f] will run again
