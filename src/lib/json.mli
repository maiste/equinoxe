(** The [JSON] module provide helpers to manipulate JSON objects. *)

type t
(** Abstract type to represent JSON objects. *)

val of_string : string -> t
(** [of_string str] takes a string [str] representing a JSON and transform it
    into an {!t} object you can manipulate with this module. *)

val geto : t -> string -> t
(** [geto json field_name] returns the {!t} value associated to the field_name. *)

val ( --> ) : t -> string -> t
(** [json --> field] is an infix operator that executes {!geto}. *)

val geta : t -> int -> t
(** [geta json nth]. returns the {!t} value associated to the nth element in the
    json. *)

val ( |-> ) : t -> int -> t
(** [json |-> nth] is an infix operator that executes {!geta}. *)

val to_int_r : t -> (int, string) result
(** [to_int_r json] transforms the [json] object into an int result with a
    printable error in case of failure. *)

val to_string_r : t -> (string, string) result
(** [to_string json] transforms the [json] into a string result with a printable
    error in case of failure.*)
